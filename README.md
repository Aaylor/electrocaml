electrocaml
=============

_This work is currently in progress_

It's an attempt to make a port of electron javascript library into OCaml. It's a project that I use to learn how to use the js\_of\_ocaml library.

The project is inspired by (ocaml-electron)[https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-electron] which is not maintened anymore. (It uses the electron's old API)
